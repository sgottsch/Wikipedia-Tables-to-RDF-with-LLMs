Your task is to create RDF triples in the Turtle format for entities described in a table in the Wikitext format, given an example table from the Wikipedia page "List of hairstyles" and triples extracted from that example table. Only use information which is directly stated in the table. Return all triples for all entities that you can find, I do not want a partial representation. Do not return placeholders, only complete objects. If you provide a URL, the URL must be stated in the table.

This is the example table:

{| class="wikitable " style="text-align: center"
|- style="background:#cccccc"
! Name !! Image !! Description
|-
| style="background:#eeeeee" | [[Bob cut]]
| [[File:Anna Wintour.jpg|120px]]
| align=left | A classic short hairstyle where it is cut above the shoulders in a blunt cut with typically no layers. This style is most common among women.
|-
| style="background:#eeeeee" | [[Bouffant]]
| [[File:Lady Bird Johnson, photo portrait, standing at rear of White House, color, crop.jpg|120px]]
| align=left | A style distinguished by smooth hair that is heightened and given extra fullness over teasing in the fringe area. |}
---
For this example table, the following triples are created:

@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

<https://example.org/resource/Bob_cut> wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle> ;
 rdfs:label "bob cut"@en ;
 wdt:P279 wd:Q111143758 ;
 wdt:P18 <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Hani%20at%20the%20Thank%20U%20Festival%202016%2001.jpg> ;
 wdt:P527 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pageboy> ;
 wdt:P527 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lob_(haircut)> ;
 wdt:P527 wd:Q111204199 .

<https://example.org/resource/Bouffant> wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle> ;
 wdt:P279 wd:Q111143758 ;
 rdfs:label "bouffant"@en ;
 wdt:P18 <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Betty%20Ford%2C%20official%20White%20House%20photo%20color%2C%201974.jpg> .

These are the labels of the properties:

wdt:P31 -> instance of
wdt:P279 -> subclass of
wdt:P18 -> image
wdt:P527 -> has part(s).
---
These are the labels of the objects:

wd:Q111143758 -> medium-length hair
wd:Q111204199 -> micro bob.
