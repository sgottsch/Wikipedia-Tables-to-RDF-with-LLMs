Some sources claim that Monks had lived there since the 4th century, but it is most commonly believed that it Was established in the 6th century by monks from the Monastery of St. Pishoy who rejected the Julian Heresy, which claimed that Christ was incorruptible. As a result, they abandoned the Monastery and established a new one which they named after the Theotokos, to emphasize that they believed in Christ's humanity and corruptibility. The Monastery was bought by Syrian Merchants in the eighth century and inhabited by Syrian Monks.\n|-\n||[[Abu Mena|Abu Mena Basilica and Complex]]\n|[[File:Abu_Mena_Ancient_Monastery_04.JPG|120px|center]]\n|[[Alexandria]]\n|[[Egypt]]\n|data-sort-value=\"265\" | late 3rd century \n|[[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] \n|Built near the place at which the Body of St. Mina the Martyr was buried, the Basilica was ordered to be built by Emperor Zenon after the Saint healed his leper daughter. A Monastic community and a city eventually sprang up near the Basilica and it became a famous site of pilgrimage. Terracotta pots with the image of the Saint and spices from his body have been found all throughout the Roman Empire and as far north as Germany. The City complex and Basilica as well as the Monastery were sacked and destroyed in the 7th century by the Arab invaders. The ruins are currently a UNESCO World Heritage site. |}\n---", "result": "@prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .\n\n<https://example.org/resource/Church_of_Alexandria> wdt:P131 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria> ;\n rdfs:label \"Church of Alexandria\"@en ;\n wdt:P17 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt> ;\n wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_(building)> ;\n wdt:P571 \"0049-01-01T00:00:00Z\"^^xsd:dateTime .\n\n<https://example.org/resource/Paromeos_Monastery> wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery> ;\n rdfs:label \"Monastery of Paromeos\"@en ;\n wdt:P17 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt> ;\n wdt:P571 \"0335-01-01T00:00:00Z\"^^xsd:dateTime .\n\n<https://example.org/resource/Monastery_of_Saint_Macarius_the_Great> wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery> ;\n rdfs:label \"Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great\"@en ;\n wdt:P17 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt> ;\n wdt:P571 \"0360-01-01T00:00:00Z\"^^xsd:dateTime .\n\n<https://example.org/resource/Monastery_of_Saint_Pishoy> wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery> ;\n rdfs:label \"Monastery of Saint Pishoy\"@en ;\n wdt:P17 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt> ;\n wdt:P571 \"0301-01-01T00:00:00Z\"^^xsd:dateTime .\n\n<https://example.org/resource/Monastery_of_Saint_Mary_Deipara> wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery> ;\n rdfs:label \"Monastery of Saint Mary Deipara\"@en ;\n wdt:P17 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt> ;\n wdt:P571 \"0301-01-01T00:00:00Z\"^^xsd:dateTime .\n\n<https://example.org/resource/Abu_Mena_Basilica_and_Complex> wdt:P131 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria> ;\n rdfs:label \"Abu Mena Basilica and Complex\"@en ;\n wdt:P17 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt> ;\n wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_(building)> ;\n wdt:P571 \"0265-01-01T00:00:00Z\"^^xsd:dateTime ."}, {"table_without_examples": "{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%\"|Building\n! style=\"width:15%\"|Image\n! style=\"width:10%\"|Location\n! style=\"width:10%\"|Country\n! style=\"width:10%\"|Oldest part \n! style=\"width:15%\"|Denomination\n! style=\"width:25%\"|Notes\n|-\n||[[Monastery of Saint John the Short]]\n|[[File:Hosios_Loukas_(nave,_vault_over_south-west_bay)_-_John_Kolobos.jpg|120px|center]]\n|[[Wadi El Natrun]]\n|[[Egypt]]\n|data-sort-value=\"301\" | 4th century \n|[[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] \n|Built by Saint John around his \"Tree of Obedience\".
