Your task is to create RDF triples in the Turtle format for entities described in a table in the Wikitext format, given an example table from the Wikipedia page "List of fictional settlements" and triples extracted from that example table. Only use information which is directly stated in the table. Return all triples for all entities that you can find, I do not want a partial representation. Do not return placeholders, only complete objects. If you provide a URL, the URL must be stated in the table.

| ''[[The Simpsons]]''
|[[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]
|'''Springfield''' is the [[List of fictional towns in animation|fictional town]] in which the [[United States|American]] [[Animation|animated]] [[sitcom]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'' is set. A mid-sized town in an undetermined state of the [[United States]], Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society.<ref>Turner, p. 55</ref> The geography of the town and its surroundings are flexible, changing to address whatever an episode's plot calls for.<ref>Turner, p. 30</ref> Springfield's location is impossible to determine; the show is deliberately evasive on the subject, providing contradictory clues and impossible information about an actual geographic location. The town was founded by [[Jebediah Springfield]]. <!--Please do not add examples of the "clues" about Springfield's location here. It is important to emphasize in the summary that Springfield *cannot be located* due to the creators' intentions. And yes, we saw the "Behind the Music" episode too.-->
