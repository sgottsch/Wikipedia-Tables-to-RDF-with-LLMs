Your task is to create RDF triples in the Turtle format for entities described in a table in the Wikitext format, given an example table from the Wikipedia page "List of fictional settlements" and triples extracted from that example table. Only use information which is directly stated in the table. Return all triples for all entities that you can find, I do not want a partial representation. Do not return placeholders, only complete objects. If you provide a URL, the URL must be stated in the table.

|[[Lankhmar]]
|nowrap| [[Fritz Leiber]]
|''[[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]]''
|'''Lankhmar''' is a populous, labyrinthine city rife with corruption. It serves as the home of Leiber's two anti-heroes Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. It also forms a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings|Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting]]''.
|-
|[[Ankh-Morpork]]
|nowrap| [[Terry Pratchett]]
|''[[Discworld]]''
|Pratchett describes '''Ankh-Morpork''' as on the far side of corrupt and polluted, and as subject to outbreaks of comedic violence and brouhaha on a fairly regular basis. Ankh-Morpork is also the mercantile capital of the Discworld. As the series proceeds, Ankh-Morpork is more and more portrayed as multi-cultural (which in this case means multi-species, with increasingly prominent populations of creatures such as dwarves, trolls, vampires, gnomes, bogeymen, zombies and werewolves) and struggling with modern real-world challenges. Even when it is under attack from a dragon, the vegetable carts still have to come in. In The Art of Discworld, Pratchett explains that the city is similar to Tallinn and central Prague, but adds that it has elements of 18th-century London, 19th-century Seattle and modern New York City.
