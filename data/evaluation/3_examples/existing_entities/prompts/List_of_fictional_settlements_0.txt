Your task is to create RDF triples in the Turtle format for entities described in a table in the Wikitext format, given an example table from the Wikipedia page "List of fictional settlements" and triples extracted from that example table. Only use information which is directly stated in the table. Return all triples for all entities that you can find, I do not want a partial representation. Do not return placeholders, only complete objects. If you provide a URL, the URL must be stated in the table.

This is the example table:

{| class="wikitable "
! Name !! Debut !! Creator(s) !! Publisher !! class=unsortable|Notes
|-
|[[Blüdhaven]]
|''[[Nightwing]]'' Vol 1 #1
|[[Chuck Dixon]], [[Scott McDaniel]]
|[[DC Comics]]
|A fictional American city located in [[New Jersey]]. A former whaling town, which was officially incorporated as a "Commonwealth" in 1912. The town had a generally poor socio-economic populace, owing in part to failed efforts to transform itself into a manufacturing and shipping center. In modern times, it became more dangerous than Gotham, ruled by gangs and a corrupt police department. [[Nightwing]] is the most common heroic presence.

|[[Coast City]]
|''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #22 (October 1959)

|[[District X]]
|''New X-Men'' #127
|[[Grant Morrison]], [[John Paul Leon]]
|[[Marvel Comics]]
|A ghetto like neighbourhood of [[New York City]], where most of the inhabitants are [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutants]], with the rise of [[Manhattan]]'s mutant population coupled with racism among normal humans, led to mutants forming their own community in a ghetto established in or around Alphabet City, Manhattan; Middle East Side, Mutant Town are its other names. A series of explosions incinerated much of the neighborhood, with Arcade's force fields preventing fire fighters from entering the area until the entire district had been utterly annihilated. Now [[District X]] has been destroyed completely. |}
