Your task is to create RDF triples in the Turtle format for entities described in a table in the Wikitext format, given an example table from the Wikipedia page "List of schools in the Auckland Region" and triples extracted from that example table. Only use information which is directly stated in the table. Return all triples for all entities that you can find, I do not want a partial representation. Do not return placeholders, only complete objects. If you provide a URL, the URL must be stated in the table.

This is the example table:

{| class="wikitable "
|-
! Name || MOE || Years || Area || Authority || Roll || Website || Notes
|-
| [[Bairds Mainfreight Primary School]] || [https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/find-school/school/profile?school=1218 1218] || 1–6 || [[Ōtara]] || State || {{NZ school roll data|1218|y}} ||  [https://archive.today/20080612121928/http://www.bairdsmainfreight.school.nz/]|| |}
---
For this example table, the following triples are created:

@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

<https://example.org/resource/Bairds_Mainfreight_Primary_School> wdt:P17 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand> ;
 wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school> ;
 rdfs:label "Bairds Mainfreight Primary School"@en ;
 wdt:P856 <https://www.bmps.school.nz/> ;
 wdt:P2196 "369"^^xsd:decimal ;
 wdt:P2196 "472"^^xsd:decimal ;
 wdt:P571 "1961-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
 wdt:P131 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Region> ;
 wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school> .
---
These are the labels of the properties:

wdt:P17 -> country
wdt:P31 -> instance of
wdt:P856 -> official website URL
wdt:P2196 -> students count
wdt:P571 -> inception
wdt:P131 -> located in the administrative territorial entity.

These are the labels of the objects:
