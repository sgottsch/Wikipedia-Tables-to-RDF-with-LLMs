Your task is to create RDF triples in the Turtle format for entities described in a table in the Wikitext format, given an example table from the Wikipedia page "List of books banned by governments" and triples extracted from that example table. Only use information which is directly stated in the table. Return all triples for all entities that you can find, I do not want a partial representation. Do not return placeholders, only complete objects. If you provide a URL, the URL must be stated in the table.

This is the example table:

{| class="wikitable "
|-
! Title
! width=100pt|Author(s)
! Year published
! Type
! Notes
|-
| ''[[Christianity not Mysterious]]''
| [[John Toland]]
| 1696
| Non-fiction
| Banned by the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] for contradicting the teaching of the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]]. Copies of the book were burnt by the public hangman in Dublin.<ref>Gilbert, J.T., ''History of the City of Dublin'' (1854). Volume III, p. 66.</ref> |}
---
For this example table, the following triples are created:

@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

<https://example.org/resource/Christianity_not_Mysterious> wdt:P136 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology> ;
 wdt:P50 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Toland> ;
 wdt:P1476 "Christianity not Mysterious"@en ;
 wdt:P407 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language> ;
 rdfs:label "Christianity not Mysterious"@en ;
 wdt:P921 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity> ;
 wdt:P31 wd:Q7725634 .
---
These are the labels of the properties:

wdt:P136 -> genre
wdt:P50 -> author
wdt:P1476 -> title
wdt:P407 -> language of work or name
wdt:P921 -> main subject
wdt:P31 -> instance of.
---
These are the labels of the objects:

wd:Q7725634 -> literary work.

This is the table for which you should extract RDF triples:
