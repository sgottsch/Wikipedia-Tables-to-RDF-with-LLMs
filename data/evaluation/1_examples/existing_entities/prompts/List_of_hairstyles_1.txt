Your task is to create RDF triples in the Turtle format for entities described in a table in the Wikitext format, given an example table from the Wikipedia page "List of hairstyles" and triples extracted from that example table. Only use information which is directly stated in the table. Return all triples for all entities that you can find, I do not want a partial representation. Do not return placeholders, only complete objects. If you provide a URL, the URL must be stated in the table.

This is the example table:

{| class="wikitable " style="text-align: center"
|- style="background:#cccccc"
! Name !! Image !! Description
|-
| style="background:#eeeeee" | [[Afro]]
| [[File:Afro 2 cropped by David Shankbone.jpg|120px]]
| align=left | A style of [[Afro-textured hair|natural African hair]] that has been grown out without any straightening or ironing, and combed regularly with special [[Comb#Afro pick|afro picks]]. In recent history, the hairstyle was popular through the late 1960s and 1970s in the United States. |}

For this example table, the following triples are created:

@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

<https://example.org/resource/Afro> wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle> ;
 wdt:P279 wd:Q111143758 ;
 wdt:P1889 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_hair> ;
 wdt:P5008 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_African_diaspora> ;
 wdt:P527 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro_puffs> ;
 rdfs:label "afro"@en ;
 wdt:P18 <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/LaurynHill%20cropped.jpg> ;
 wdt:P18 <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Natural%20Afro%20-%20hair%20type%204c-%20model%20Gwyneth%20Ellis.jpg> ;
 wdt:P279 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinky_hair> ;
 wdt:P279 wd:Q102247646 .
---
These are the labels of the properties:

wdt:P31 -> instance of
wdt:P279 -> subclass of
wdt:P1889 -> different from
wdt:P5008 -> on focus list of Wikimedia project
wdt:P527 -> has part(s)
wdt:P18 -> image.
---
These are the labels of the objects:

wd:Q111143758 -> medium-length hair
wd:Q102247646 -> shoulder-length hair.

This is the table for which you should extract RDF triples:

{| class="wikitable " style="text-align: center"
|- style="background:#cccccc"
! Name !! Image !! Description
|-
| style="background:#eeeeee" | [[Regular haircut|Taper cut]]
|
| align=left | Alternative name for a regular haircut.
