Your task is to create RDF triples in the Turtle format for entities described in a table in the Wikitext format, given an example table from the Wikipedia page "List of mosques in Africa" and triples extracted from that example table. Only use information which is directly stated in the table. Return all triples for all entities that you can find, I do not want a partial representation. Do not return placeholders, only complete objects. If you provide a URL, the URL must be stated in the table.

This is the example table:

{| class="wikitable "
|-
!Name
!class=unsortable|Images
!Country
!City
![[Gregorian calendar|Year]]
!class=unsortable|Remarks
|- valign=top id="Ethiopia"
| [[Al Nejashi Mosque]]

For this example table, the following triples are created:

@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

<https://example.org/resource/Al_Nejashi_Mosque> wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque> ;
 rdfs:label "Al Nejashi Mosque"@en ;
 wdt:P17 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia> ;
 wdt:P18 <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Negash%2C%20la%20moschea%20sul%20sito%20della%20pi%C3%B9%20antica%20moschea%20d%27etiopia%2C%20del%20vii%20secolo%2003.jpg> .

These are the labels of the properties:

wdt:P31 -> instance of
wdt:P17 -> country
wdt:P18 -> image.

These are the labels of the objects:
