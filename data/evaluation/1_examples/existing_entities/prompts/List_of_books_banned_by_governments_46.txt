Your task is to create RDF triples in the Turtle format for entities described in a table in the Wikitext format, given an example table from the Wikipedia page "List of books banned by governments" and triples extracted from that example table. Only use information which is directly stated in the table. Return all triples for all entities that you can find, I do not want a partial representation. Do not return placeholders, only complete objects. If you provide a URL, the URL must be stated in the table.

This is the example table:

{| class="wikitable "
|-
! Title
! Author(s)
! Year published
! Type
! Notes
|-
| ''[[Value, Price and Profit]]''
| [[Karl Marx]]
| 1865
| Non-fiction
| rowspan="27" | Banned under the Internal Security (Prohibition of Publications) (Consolidation) Order.<ref name="prohibitionsingapore">{{Singapore legislation|title=Internal Security (Prohibition of Publications) (Consolidation) Order|url= https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/ISA1960-OR1|dateformat=DD-MM-YYYY|cap=143|sltype=O|no=413|ed=1990}}</ref> |}

For this example table, the following triples are created:

@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

<https://example.org/resource/Value,_Price_and_Profit> wdt:P136 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay> ;
 wdt:P577 "1898-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
 wdt:P6216 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain> ;
 wdt:P50 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx> ;
 rdfs:label "Value, Price and Profit"@en ;
 wdt:P953 <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/> ;
 wdt:P18 <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Lohn%20Preis%20und%20Profit.jpg> ;
 wdt:P31 wd:Q7725634 ;
 wdt:P407 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language> .
---
These are the labels of the properties:

wdt:P136 -> genre
wdt:P577 -> publication date
wdt:P6216 -> copyright status
wdt:P50 -> author
wdt:P953 -> full work available at URL
wdt:P18 -> image
wdt:P31 -> instance of
wdt:P407 -> language of work or name.
---
These are the labels of the objects:

wd:Q7725634 -> literary work.
