Your task is to create RDF triples in the Turtle format for entities described in a table in the Wikitext format, given an example table from the Wikipedia page "List of clock towers in India" and triples extracted from that example table. Only use information which is directly stated in the table. Return all triples for all entities that you can find, I do not want a partial representation. Do not return placeholders, only complete objects. If you provide a URL, the URL must be stated in the table.

This is the example table:

{| class="wikitable "
!Name
!City/Town
!State/Province
!Built
!Image
!Notes
|-
|[[Aligarh Clock Tower]]
|[[Aligarh]]
|[[Uttar Pradesh]]
|
|[[File:Aligarh clock house.jpg|100px]]
|<ref name=Singh2021.1>{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Dr Yatindra Pal |title=Clock towers of India |date=2021 |publisher=Blue Rose Publishers |isbn=978-9-35427-256-1 |pages=6–7 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MI0TEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA6 |language=en |chapter=1. Aligarh }}</ref> |}

For this example table, the following triples are created:

@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

<https://example.org/resource/Aligarh_Clock_Tower> wdt:P17 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India> ;
 rdfs:label "Aligarh Clock Tower"@en ;
 wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_tower> .
---
These are the labels of the properties:

wdt:P17 -> country
wdt:P31 -> instance of.
---
These are the labels of the objects:
