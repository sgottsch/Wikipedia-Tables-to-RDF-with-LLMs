Your task is to create RDF triples in the Turtle format for entities described in a table in the Wikitext format, given an example table from the Wikipedia page "List of mosques in the United Kingdom" and triples extracted from that example table. Only use information which is directly stated in the table. Return all triples for all entities that you can find, I do not want a partial representation. Do not return placeholders, only complete objects. If you provide a URL, the URL must be stated in the table.

This is the example table:

{| class="wikitable "
|-
! width="200" align="left" |Name
! width="160" align="center" class="unsortable" |Images
! width="150" align="left" |City
! width="50" align="left" |Year
! width="60" align="left" |Groups
! width="250" align="left" class="unsortable" |Remarks

For this example table, the following triples are created:

@prefix wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .
@prefix wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

<https://example.org/resource/Abbey_Mills_Mosque> wdt:P131 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratford,_London> ;
 wdt:P7959 wd:Q67442940 ;
 rdfs:label "Abbey Mills Mosque"@en ;
 wdt:P1083 "2500"^^xsd:decimal ;
 wdt:P18 <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Abbey%20Mills%20Mosque%20%282392935331%29.jpg> ;
 wdt:P31 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque> ;
 wdt:P84 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_and_Morrison> ;
 wdt:P17 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom> .

These are the labels of the properties:

wdt:P131 -> located in the administrative territorial entity
wdt:P7959 -> historic county
wdt:P1083 -> maximum capacity
wdt:P18 -> image
wdt:P31 -> instance of
wdt:P84 -> architect
wdt:P17 -> country.

These are the labels of the objects:

wd:Q67442940 -> Essex.
